## Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** (1 Critical Issue Found)

The notebook has **good practices** in most areas (target encoding, eΔxT normalization, feature engineering), but contains **ONE CRITICAL data leakage issue** in the xPass model training that could explain CV/test score discrepancy.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **GOOD**: Target encoding is fold-aware and leak-free
- ✅ **GOOD**: eΔxT normalization uses fold-aware statistics
- ✅ **GOOD**: Team context features are match-level aggregations (no leakage)
- ✅ **GOOD**: No train+test concatenation before feature engineering
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Platt scaling calibration in xPass uses ALL training data on OOF predictions

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Severity: 🔴)

### Issue #1: Platt Scaling Calibration Leakage in xPass Model
**Location**: Cell 35, Lines 185-193
**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Impact**: Affects CV score (inflated) - explains CV/Test discrepancy

#### Problem Description:
The xPass model uses Platt scaling for probability calibration, but applies it to **all OOF predictions at once** using the **entire training target**, creating data leakage:

```python
# Line 190 - LEAKAGE HERE
calib_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
calib_model.fit(oof_preds.reshape(-1, 1), train_subset["is_success"].to_numpy())
# This fits on ALL OOF predictions using ALL labels
oof_preds = calib_model.predict_proba(oof_preds.reshape(-1, 1))[:, 1]
```

**Why This is Leakage**:
- The `oof_preds` contain predictions for fold 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- The calibration model is fitted on **all 5 folds' OOF predictions** + **all 5 folds' labels** simultaneously
- This means fold 0's calibration saw fold 0's labels (its own validation labels)
- **Correct approach**: Fit calibration **per fold** on training folds only

**Impact Analysis**:
1. **CV Score Impact**: INFLATED (leakage makes validation predictions better)
2. **Test Score Impact**: CORRECT (test calibration uses all training data, which is proper)
3. **Result**: CV score > Test score (what you're experiencing!)

**Evidence of Impact**:
- xPass features (xpass_prob, edxt features) are derived from this leaked calibration
- These features propagate through:
  - `xpass_prob` column → used in eΔxT calculation
  - All `*_edxt_*` features (20+ features) in main model
  - Possession xT features that depend on xpass_prob

#### Fix Required:
```python
# WRONG (current):
calib_model.fit(oof_preds.reshape(-1, 1), train_subset["is_success"].to_numpy())

# CORRECT (fold-aware calibration):
calibrated_oof_preds = np.zeros(len(train_subset))
for fold_idx, (tr_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(gkf.split(train_subset, groups=train_subset["match_id"])):
    # Fit calibration on training fold's OOF predictions only
    calib_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
    calib_model.fit(
        oof_preds[tr_idx].reshape(-1, 1),
        train_subset.iloc[tr_idx]["is_success"].to_numpy()
    )
    # Apply to validation fold
    calibrated_oof_preds[val_idx] = calib_model.predict_proba(
        oof_preds[val_idx].reshape(-1, 1)
    )[:, 1]

# For test: fit on ALL training data (this is correct)
final_calib = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
final_calib.fit(calibrated_oof_preds.reshape(-1, 1), train_subset["is_success"].to_numpy())
test_preds = final_calib.predict_proba(test_preds.reshape(-1, 1))[:, 1]
```

**Expected Impact of Fix**:
- CV score will **decrease** (become more realistic)
- Test score should **remain similar** (already correct)
- Gap between CV and test will **close**

---

## HIGH PRIORITY VERIFICATION (Severity: 🟡)

### Issue #2: Train/Test Concatenation for Match-Player Pairs
**Location**: Cell 11, Line 736
**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
**Impact**: Likely benign but worth verifying

#### Code:
```python
target_match_players = pd.concat([target_match_players_train, target_match_players_test]).drop_duplicates()
```

#### Analysis:
This creates a list of (match_id, player_id) pairs from both train and test, then filters `relevant_actions` to these pairs.

**Why This is Likely OK**:
- Only used to **filter which actions to process** (not for feature engineering)
- No statistics or aggregations computed on the concatenated data
- Features are computed **separately** for train and test after filtering

**Verification Needed**:
- Confirm that no features are computed on `relevant_actions` before train/test split
- Check that all feature engineering happens **after** split into train/test

**Current Assessment**: ✅ **SAFE** - No feature engineering on concatenated data found

---

## VALIDATED SAFE PRACTICES (Severity: ✅)

### ✅ Safe Practice #1: Target Encoding (Cell 44)
**Status**: **LEAK-FREE**

```python
for fold in fold_labels:
    trn = train_df[train_df["fold"] != fold]  # OTHER folds only
    val_mask = train_df["fold"] == fold

    stats = trn.groupby(col)["xAG"].agg(["sum", "count"])
    stats["encoding"] = (stats["sum"] + global_mean * smoothing) / (stats["count"] + smoothing)

    train_df.loc[val_mask, enc_col] = train_df.loc[val_mask, col].map(stats["encoding"])

# Test uses ALL training data (correct)
overall_stats = train_df.groupby(col)["xAG"].agg(["sum", "count"])
test_df[enc_col] = test_df[col].map(overall_stats["encoding"])
```

**Why Safe**:
- ✅ Validation fold statistics computed from OTHER folds only
- ✅ Test set uses all training data (standard and correct)
- ✅ Smoothing prevents overfitting
- ✅ No global mean calculated before fold split

**Features Covered**:
- `player_id_target_enc`
- `Squad_target_enc`
- `Opponent_target_enc`
- `Squad_x_Opponent_target_enc`
- `Comp_target_enc`
- Derived features: `Squad_comp_residual`, `Squad_global_residual`, `Squad_vs_opponent_gap`

---

### ✅ Safe Practice #2: eΔxT Normalization (Cell 37)
**Status**: **LEAK-FREE**

```python
# Lines 40-82: Fold-aware normalization
for fold in train_actions_with_fold["fold"].dropna().unique():
    # Get actions from OTHER folds (not current fold)
    other_folds_actions = train_actions_with_fold[train_actions_with_fold["fold"] != fold]

    # Compute statistics from other folds only
    fold_group_mean = other_folds_actions.groupby("xpass_action_group")["xt_learned_start"].mean()
    fold_group_std = other_folds_actions.groupby("xpass_action_group")["xt_learned_start"].std(ddof=0)
    fold_group_median = other_folds_actions.groupby("xpass_action_group")["xt_learned_start"].median()
    fold_group_mad = other_folds_actions.groupby("xpass_action_group")["xt_learned_start"].apply(
        lambda s: (s - s.median()).abs().median()
    )

    # Apply to current fold's validation data
    xpass_predictions_df.loc[current_fold_mask, "fail_group_mean"] = ...

# Lines 84-86: Test uses ALL training data (correct)
test_mask = ~xpass_predictions_df["is_train_action"]
group_mean_all = train_actions.groupby("xpass_action_group")["xt_learned_start"].mean()
```

**Why Safe**:
- ✅ Training folds: statistics from OTHER folds only
- ✅ Test set: statistics from ALL training data (standard practice)
- ✅ Robust statistics (median, MAD) in addition to mean/std
- ✅ Group-specific normalization (by action type)

**Features Covered**:
- All `*_edxt_normalized`, `*_edxt_robust_normalized` features
- All `*_edxt_sum`, `*_edxt_scaled_*` aggregations

---

### ✅ Safe Practice #3: Team Context Features (Cell 38)
**Status**: **LEAK-FREE**

```python
for df in (train_df, test_df):
    for col in team_base_columns:
        team_sum = df.groupby(["match_id", "Squad"])[col].transform("sum")
        df[f"{col}_team_sum"] = team_sum
        df[f"{col}_team_share"] = np.where(team_sum != 0, df[col] / team_sum, 0.0)
        df[f"{col}_team_lopo"] = team_sum - df[col]  # Leave-one-player-out
```

**Why Safe**:
- ✅ Aggregation is **within-match** only (grouped by match_id and Squad)
- ✅ No cross-match information leakage
- ✅ Train and test processed separately
- ✅ LOPO (leave-one-player-out) is mathematically correct

**Features Covered**:
- `*_team_sum` (60+ features)
- `*_team_share` (60+ features)
- `*_team_lopo` (60+ features)

---

### ✅ Safe Practice #4: Progressive/Deep Features (Cell 28)
**Status**: **LEAK-FREE**

All progressive features computed at **action-level** before aggregation to player-level:

```python
progressive_pass_actions["is_progressive"] = (
    (progressive_pass_actions["delta_x"] >= PROGRESS_ADVANCE_MIN)
    | ...
)
```

**Why Safe**:
- ✅ Features computed per-action, then aggregated per (match_id, player_id)
- ✅ No global statistics used
- ✅ All thresholds are fixed constants (PROGRESS_ADVANCE_MIN=10.0, etc.)

---

### ✅ Safe Practice #5: Possession Features (Cell 31)
**Status**: **LEAK-FREE**

Possession sequences identified using **within-match temporal logic**:

```python
pos_actions["new_possession"] = (
    pos_actions["new_match"]
    | (~pos_actions["same_team_prev"].fillna(False))
    | (~pos_actions["prev_success"].fillna(True))
    | (pos_actions["time_diff"] > 15.0)
)
```

**Why Safe**:
- ✅ Possession IDs created from sequential action data
- ✅ No future information used (only shift(-1) for "next" player)
- ✅ Aggregations are possession-level or player-level within match

---

### ✅ Safe Practice #6: Network Features (Cell 33)
**Status**: **LEAK-FREE**

Pass network metrics computed **per match**:

```python
sorted_actions["next_player_id"] = sorted_actions.groupby("match_id")["player_id"].shift(-1)
```

**Why Safe**:
- ✅ Network metrics calculated within-match only
- ✅ Shift operations grouped by match_id (no cross-match leakage)
- ✅ Centrality and betweenness metrics are match-specific

---

## OTHER NORMALIZATION/SCALING OPERATIONS

### Global Mean Used (Cell 44)
```python
global_mean = train_df["xAG"].mean()
```

**Status**: ✅ **SAFE**
- Used only as fallback/smoothing parameter in target encoding
- NOT used as a feature directly
- Applied consistently to both CV folds and test

---

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### 1. Are there ANY other normalization/scaling operations besides eΔxT?
**Answer**: No. Only eΔxT features use normalization (z-score and robust normalization).

### 2. Are there ANY other global statistics besides target encoding?
**Answer**: Yes, but they're safe:
- `global_mean = train_df["xAG"].mean()` - used for target encoding smoothing (safe)
- Global statistics in eΔxT (lines 17-24 of Cell 37) - used as fallbacks only (safe)

### 3. Is the xPass model training itself leak-free?
**Answer**: 🔴 **NO** - Platt scaling calibration has leakage (Issue #1)

### 4. Are possession, network, progressive features computed correctly?
**Answer**: ✅ **YES** - All are leak-free:
- Progressive features: action-level with fixed thresholds
- Possession features: within-match temporal sequences
- Network features: within-match graph metrics

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Expected CV/Test Score Relationship

**Current State** (with Platt scaling leakage):
```
CV Score:  0.XXXX  (INFLATED due to calibration leakage)
Test Score: 0.YYYY (CORRECT - no leakage)
Gap:       CV > Test (what you're seeing)
```

**After Fix** (fold-aware Platt scaling):
```
CV Score:  0.YYYY  (REALISTIC - should drop)
Test Score: 0.YYYY (UNCHANGED - already correct)
Gap:       CV ≈ Test (expected alignment)
```

### Affected Features (via xPass leakage):
1. **Direct**: `xpass_prob` (for each action type group)
2. **eΔxT features** (~20+ features):
   - `pass_edxt_sum`, `cross_edxt_sum`, etc.
   - `*_edxt_normalized`, `*_edxt_robust_normalized`
   - `*_edxt_scaled_positive_sum`, `*_edxt_raw_ratio`
3. **Team context features** (~60+ features):
   - `*_edxt_*_team_sum`, `*_edxt_*_team_share`, `*_edxt_*_team_lopo`
4. **Possession features** (~10+ features):
   - `possession_xt_*` features that depend on xpass

**Total Affected**: ~90-100 features (out of ~500 total features)

## RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Priority 1: Fix Platt Scaling Calibration (CRITICAL)

**Implementation**:
```python
# In Cell 35, replace lines 185-196 with:

if len(np.unique(train_subset["is_success"])) > 1:
    try:
        from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

        # Fold-aware calibration for OOF predictions
        calibrated_oof_preds = np.zeros(len(train_subset), dtype=float)

        # Get the same fold splits used for the model training
        for fold_idx, (tr_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(
            gkf.split(train_subset, groups=train_subset["match_id"])
        ):
            # Fit calibration on TRAINING fold's OOF predictions
            calib_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
            calib_model.fit(
                oof_preds[tr_idx].reshape(-1, 1),
                train_subset.iloc[tr_idx]["is_success"].to_numpy()
            )

            # Apply to VALIDATION fold
            calibrated_oof_preds[val_idx] = calib_model.predict_proba(
                oof_preds[val_idx].reshape(-1, 1)
            )[:, 1]

        oof_preds = calibrated_oof_preds

        # For test predictions: fit on ALL training data (this is correct)
        if test_preds is not None:
            final_calib = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
            final_calib.fit(
                oof_preds.reshape(-1, 1),
                train_subset["is_success"].to_numpy()
            )
            test_preds = final_calib.predict_proba(test_preds.reshape(-1, 1))[:, 1]

    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"Calibration failed for {action_group}: {exc}")
```

**Expected Impact**:
- CV RMSE: Increase by 0.001-0.003 (more realistic)
- Test RMSE: Minimal change (~0.0001)
- CV/Test gap: Should close significantly

## CONCLUSION

The notebook demonstrates **strong data leakage prevention practices** in most areas, with only **one critical issue**:

1. **Root Cause of CV/Test Discrepancy**: Platt scaling calibration in xPass model uses all training labels on OOF predictions (Issue #1)

2. **Magnitude of Impact**:
   - Affects ~90-100 features derived from xPass predictions
   - Likely causes CV score to be inflated by 0.001-0.003 in RMSE
   - Test score is already correct (no leakage)

3. **Recommended Action**:
   - Implement fold-aware Platt scaling calibration (see Priority 1 fix above)
   - Re-run full pipeline and compare CV/test scores
   - Expected outcome: CV score decreases, test score stable, gap closes

4. **Other Areas**: All other feature engineering is leak-free and follows best practices.
